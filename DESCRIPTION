Description: Bisque provides tools to accurately estimate cell type abundances 
    from heterogeneous bulk expression. A reference-based method utilizes
    single-cell information to generate a signature matrix and transformation
    of bulk expression for accurate regression based estimates. A marker-based
    method utilizes known cell-specific marker genes to measure relative
    abundances across samples.
